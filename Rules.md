# Rules of the #30Days Of #CodetoRust Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will Code on Rust for at least an hour every day for the next 30 days.*

#### Start Date
June 20th, 2017. [PUT YOUR DATE HERE]

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #CodetoRust/ #RainofRust
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](FAQ.md))


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, you should add a link to everydays update in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post, to your code on github.
2. Share about this to your friends and community people. Follow [Rust Language](https://twitter.com/rustlang) on Twitter. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the rust community.
3. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
