Rust India community came up with RainOfRust Campaign to spread the awesomeness of Rust language. This is focused on introducing and teaching the state of art system programming language Rust to Students/ Developers and Mozillians around. 

# I've joined the #30Days of #CodetoRust Challenge.

## Contents
* [Rules](Rules.md)
* [Log - click here to see my progress](Log.md)
* [FAQ](FAQ.md)
* [Resources](Resources.md)

## If you've decided to join:
0. Check out the [RainofRust](https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia) Campaign page.
1. Join and organize a [RainofRust](https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/RainOfRust) event.
2. Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](Log.md) daily. [Example](https://github.com/DineshMv/30Days-of-CodetoRust/blob/master/Log.md).
3. **Code on rust for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 30 days.**
4. Change the date in [Rules](Rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
5. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6. **Tweet your progress every day using the #CodetoRust & #RainofRust hashtags.**
7. Follow [Rust Language](https://twitter.com/rustlang) on Twitter. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the rust community.
8. Important: Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
9. If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo.
